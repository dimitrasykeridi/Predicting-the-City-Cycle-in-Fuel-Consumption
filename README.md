# Predicting-the-City_Cycle-in-Fuel-Consumption
## Background Information

### Data Files
The main file we used is mpg.data.xlsx, which contains information about eight car attributes (e.g., MPG, cylinders, horsepower, car name). These help car rental companies decide when to update their fleets by predicting fuel efficiency (MPG).

### Resources
The dataset is provided under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) 'Public Domain Dedication' license ( https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ ) , so we are authorized to use it in this project.

### Data Processes
#### Exploratory Data Analysis
The first step in our analysis was exploring the data. We began by importing the necessary Python libraries to visualize the data and calculate key metrics for our model. Below you can see some of our frequently used commands for that step.
