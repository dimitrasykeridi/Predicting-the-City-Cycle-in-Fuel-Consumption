## Background Information

### Data Files
The main file we used is mpg.data.xlsx, which contains information about eight car attributes (e.g., MPG, cylinders, horsepower, car name). These help car rental companies decide when to update their fleets by predicting fuel efficiency (MPG).

### Resources
